# Agents.md — Guidance for AI-assisted Development
_An overview of the current repository and its related projects, generated by [AgentPrimer](https://github.com/deanthecoder/AgentPrimer)._
## Summary for Agents
Use this overview as factual context when generating or editing code.  
Avoid unnecessary token use; prefer referencing this document instead of re-parsing source files.
## Agent Instructions (Overview)
- Read this report top-to-bottom to understand the repository structure, technologies, and conventions.
- Look for **Agent note** callouts embedded in specific sections; they contain targeted guidance.
- Keep context usage lean: prefer summaries and interfaces over ingesting full source files.
- Match the English style as reported below.
- Prefer existing frameworks, tests, and naming conventions shown here.
## Repositories (1)
> **Agent note:** Sub-modules and sibling repositories often expose reusable libraries (e.g., extension methods, utilities). Cross-reference these before re-implementing.

  - https://github.com/deanthecoder/ZXSpeculator

## NuGet (11)
> **Agent note:** Prefer solutions using the listed packages and frameworks; avoid introducing new technologies without justification.

  `Avalonia` | `DialogHost.Avalonia` | `DotNetZip` | `K4os.Compression.LZ4`
  `Material.Avalonia` | `Material.Icons.Avalonia` | `Newtonsoft.Json`
  `NSubstitute` | `NUnit` | `OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL` | `SharpHook`
## Preferences
> **Agent note:** Align with nullable settings, test framework/assertion style, mocking approach, and UI patterns already used in this codebase.

* Nullable : disabled
* Tests    : NUnit
* Mocking  : NSubstitute
* UI       : Avalonia
## Projects
> **Agent note:** Treat internal projects as core dependencies; follow their naming, layering, and public APIs when extending functionality.
